# Regression-Project
Projects containing regression as the primary method to do prediction.

The Assignment is based on Cross-section data originating from the March 1988 Current 
Population Survey by the US Census Bureau.
The sample consists of men aged 18 to 70 with positive annual income greater than USD 50 in 
1992, who are not self-employed nor working without pay. Wages are deflated by the deflator of 
Personal Consumption Expenditure for 1992.
The Data
A data frame containing 28,155 observations on 7 variables.
1. Wage : Wage (in dollars per week).
2. Education: Number of years of education.
3. Experience : Number of years of potential work experience.
4. Ethnicity: Factor with levels "cauc" and "afam" (African-American).
5. Smsa : Factor. Does the individual reside in a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area 
(SMSA)?
6. Region: Factor with levels "northeast", "midwest", "south", "west".
7. Parttime: Factor. Does the individual work part-time?
Project:
Build an appropriate model to predict Wages based on the data provided in the dataset. The 
assignment should include exploratory data analysis, data preparation , building predictive 
model for Wages and measurement of accuracy using the correct metrics as per the algorithm 
used.
